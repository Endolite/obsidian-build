# obsidian-build
A WIP plugin for Obsidian that
1. adds a run button to each codeblock
2. creates a file containing the content of the codeblock with the appropriate extension in the root directory of the repository when the button is clicked
3. run the file in the terminal with the appropriate command and
4. delete the file.

It currently works on **MacOS for Python, Java, C++, and Lua only**, but Linux and Windows are planned in the future. Additional languages are simple to add, and will be added as a need or request arises.
